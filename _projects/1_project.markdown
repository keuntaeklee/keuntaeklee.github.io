The 1:5 scale vehicle, the AutoRally platform above is designed to test Machine Learning and control algorithms for autonomous driving, especially in offroad environments.

The platform is 1m long and can run in 60mph.
The sensors attached to the vehicle are IMU, GPS, two 120x1024, 70fps cameras, and the Hall-effect rotation sensors to measure wheel speed.
The computer mounted on the vehicle has CPU, GPU, WiFi, and XBee.

I have been working on a number of sub projects under the AutoRally project and the developed algorithms and controllers are tested at real tracks seen below.
