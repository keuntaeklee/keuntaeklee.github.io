## The Challenge

*The AlphaPilot challenge tests teams of up to 10 participants on their ability to design an AI framework - powered by the NVIDIA Xavier GPU for autonomous systems - capable of flying a drone through three-dimensional race courses using only machine vision and guidance, navigation, and control algorithms. Teams will not have prior knowledge of the exact course layouts, nor will they benefit from GPS, data off-boarding or human intervention of any kind. Designed by DRL, the autonomous drone will provide the sensing, agility and speed needed for competitive racing as part of DRL’s new Artificial Intelligence Robotic Racing (AIRR) Circuit, starting in fall 2019.*

*This is a competition of AI quality – all other racing variables, including the drone hardware, are controlled.*

*AlphaPilot is the first large-scale open innovation challenge of its kind focused on advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy.*

## Team ICARUS

My team *ICARUS* (ACDS AlphaPilot) is the 2019 AlphaPilot Qualifier, one of the top 9 teams out of the 424 teams participated worldwide, who went to the final round.
