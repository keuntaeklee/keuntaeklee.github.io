Hi, my name is Keuntaek Lee and I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon. I did my Ph.D. in the fields of machine learning and deep learning and I was advised by <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/contact/">Dr. Evangelos A. Theodorou </a> at <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. My research interests include optimization, probabilistic deep learning, reinforcement learning, control theory, and computer vision.

During my Ph.D. studies, I was lucky to work on interesting and challenging research projects including
the <a href="https://autorally.github.io/">AutoRally</a> and the <a href="https://www.herox.com/alphapilot/teams">AlphaPilot</a>, developing safe ML/DL algorithms for motion planning, decision making, control, and behavior prediction of autonomous vehicles and robots.

I also worked at <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/">Honda Research Institute (HRI)-US</a> as a research intern, in the ML-based autonomous driving team.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with the highest honors from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.
