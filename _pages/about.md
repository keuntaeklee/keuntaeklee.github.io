Hi, my name is Keuntaek Lee and I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Robotics AI. I did my Ph.D. study in the field of robotics and machine learning and I was advised by <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/contact/">Dr. Evangelos A. Theodorou </a> at <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. My research interests include machine learning, robotics, control theory, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and explainable AI.

During my Ph.D. study, I was lucky to work on interesting and challenging research projects including
the <a href="https://autorally.github.io/">AutoRally</a> and the <a href="https://www.herox.com/alphapilot/teams">AlphaPilot</a>, developing safe machine learning algorithms for motion planning, decision making, control, and behavior prediction of autonomous vehicles and robots.

I also worked at <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/">Honda Research Institute (HRI)-US</a> as a research intern, in the autonomous driving team, under the supervision of Dr. Sangjae Bae and Dr. David Isele.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with the highest honors from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.
