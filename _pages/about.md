Hi, my name is Keuntaek Lee and I am a Ph.D. student advised by <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/contact/">Prof. Evangelos A. Theodorou </a> at <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. My research interests include robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and control theory.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with the highest honors from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.

My two main research projects are the <a href="https://autorally.github.io/">AutoRally</a> and the <a href="https://www.herox.com/alphapilot/teams">AlphaPilot</a>, developing algorithms and controllers for safe autonomous systems.
